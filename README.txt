Hello and welcome to Tanks!

You play as a tank.

You can use WASD or arrow keys to move your tank.

Your tank will follow your mouse cursor with it's barrel and fire when you left click.

Your objective is to destroy each of the hostile tanks without taking fatal damage yourself.

There are a few unimplemented features that I would like to add in the future. Such as projectiles colliding with each other.
